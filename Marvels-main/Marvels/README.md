# Marvels
The purpose of this project is to develop a non-trivial app using MVVM+C, and including a bunch of unit tests.  The app leverages the Marvel API to display descriptions and images of the 1000+ characters in the Marvel universe.  This project has been built using UIKit and no third party dependencies.
