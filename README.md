Technical details
Architecture
This app has been developed using a simple MVVM architectural pattern. MVVM (Model View ViewModel) is an architectural pattern which attempts to more clearly separate the development of user-interfaces (UI) from that of the business logic and behaviour in an application. The app has three major layers:

The Presentation layer, which contains the views and other UIKit-related units.
The Domain layer, which contains the business logic and use cases.
The Data layer, which contains the networking, the models and authentication logic needed to connect to the Marvel API.
Tests
This app has a bunch of unit tests. The networking model, as well as the models and authentication logic has been tested thoroughly. The code coverage is not 100% as it contains the unit test cases only.
